## Conclusion

The current Cloudflare with S3 via VPC endpoint architecture (Method 1), while providing enhanced security and control through private S3 access and Cloudflare Access integration, introduces significant costs that make it unsuitable for the development environment without optimization. The primary cost drivers are the NAT Gateway and EC2 instance, which are essential for running the Cloudflare tunnel daemon and providing secure access to S3 via VPC endpoint.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Cost Impact:** The new architecture increases costs by nearly 29,000%
2. **Primary Driver:** NAT Gateway represents 81% of the cost increase
3. **Optimization Potential:** Auto-shutdown can reduce costs by 60%
4. **Architecture Decision:** Consider different approaches per environment

### Next Steps

1. Implement immediate cost optimizations (auto-shutdown)
2. Set up comprehensive cost monitoring
3. Evaluate architecture alternatives for development environment
4. Document lessons learned for staging/production deployments
