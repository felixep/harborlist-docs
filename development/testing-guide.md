# Development Testing Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy and procedures for the HarborList platform.

## Testing Strategy

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests:** Test individual components and functions
2. **Integration Tests:** Test component interactions
3. **End-to-End Tests:** Test complete user workflows
4. **Performance Tests:** Test system performance and scalability

### Test Coverage Goals

- Unit tests: 80% code coverage minimum
- Integration tests: Critical user paths
- E2E tests: Core business workflows

## Running Tests

### Backend Tests

```bash
cd backend
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:unit          # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration   # Integration tests only
npm run test:coverage      # Generate coverage report
```

### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd frontend
npm test                   # Run all tests
npm run test:unit         # Unit tests only
npm run test:e2e          # End-to-end tests
npm run test:coverage     # Generate coverage report
```

## Test Structure

### Backend Test Organization

```
backend/src/
├── __tests__/           # Test files
├── test-utils/          # Test utilities
└── fixtures/            # Test data
```

### Frontend Test Organization

```
frontend/src/
├── __tests__/           # Test files
├── test-utils/          # Test utilities
└── cypress/             # E2E tests
```

## Writing Tests

### Unit Test Guidelines

- Test one thing at a time
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies

### Integration Test Guidelines

- Test realistic scenarios
- Use test databases
- Clean up after tests
- Test error conditions

## Continuous Integration

Tests are automatically run on:
- Pull request creation
- Code commits to main branch
- Scheduled nightly runs

## Test Data Management

### Fixtures
- Use consistent test data
- Avoid hardcoded values
- Clean up test data after runs

### Database Testing
- Use separate test databases
- Reset state between tests
- Use transactions for isolation

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing
- Test API endpoints under load
- Measure response times
- Identify bottlenecks

### Stress Testing
- Test system limits
- Verify graceful degradation
- Test recovery procedures

## Status

The testing framework is implemented and actively used during development. Test coverage is continuously monitored and improved.
