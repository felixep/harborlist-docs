# Development Coding Standards

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript Standards

#### General Principles
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint configuration rules
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write self-documenting code with clear intent

#### Formatting
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use trailing commas in multi-line structures
- Use single quotes for strings

#### File Organization
```
src/
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
├── services/           # API and business logic
├── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
├── utils/              # Utility functions
└── __tests__/          # Test files
```

### Backend Standards

#### API Design
- Use RESTful conventions
- Consistent error response format
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Input validation on all endpoints

#### Database
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper indexing
- Follow naming conventions
- Document schema changes

### Frontend Standards

#### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper prop types
- Follow component composition patterns
- Use custom hooks for shared logic

#### State Management
- Use React Query for server state
- Local state with useState/useReducer
- Context for global application state
- Avoid prop drilling

### Testing Standards

#### Unit Tests
- Test business logic thoroughly
- Mock external dependencies
- Use descriptive test names
- Maintain high test coverage

#### Integration Tests
- Test API endpoints
- Test component interactions
- Use realistic test data
- Clean up after tests

### Documentation Standards

#### Code Comments
- Document complex business logic
- Explain non-obvious decisions
- Keep comments up to date
- Use JSDoc for functions

#### README Files
- Clear setup instructions
- Usage examples
- Contribution guidelines
- Troubleshooting section

### Git Standards

#### Commit Messages
- Use conventional commit format
- Write clear, descriptive messages
- Reference issue numbers
- Keep commits atomic

#### Branch Naming
- feature/description
- bugfix/description
- hotfix/description
- Use kebab-case

### Security Standards

#### Authentication
- Never store passwords in plain text
- Use secure session management
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Validate all user inputs

#### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Use HTTPS everywhere
- Implement rate limiting
- Log security events

## Code Review Process

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are included and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Performance impact considered

### Review Guidelines
- Be constructive and respectful
- Focus on code, not the person
- Explain reasoning for suggestions
- Approve when standards are met

## Tools and Automation

### Linting
- ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Prettier for code formatting
- Pre-commit hooks for validation
- CI/CD integration

### Testing Tools
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Cypress for E2E testing
- Coverage reporting

## Enforcement

These standards are enforced through:
- Automated linting in CI/CD
- Code review requirements
- Pre-commit hooks
- Regular team reviews

For questions about these standards, consult the development team or create an issue for discussion.
