# Development Workflow Guide

This guide outlines the complete development workflow for the MarineMarket boat listing platform, including Git practices, code review processes, CI/CD pipelines, and collaboration guidelines.

## üéØ Workflow Overview

Our development workflow follows **GitFlow** principles with modern DevOps practices:

1. **Feature Development** ‚Üí Feature branches from `main`
2. **Code Review** ‚Üí Pull requests with automated checks
3. **Testing** ‚Üí Automated testing at multiple levels
4. **Integration** ‚Üí Continuous integration with quality gates
5. **Deployment** ‚Üí Automated deployment to multiple environments
6. **Monitoring** ‚Üí Post-deployment monitoring and feedback

## üå≥ Git Workflow and Branching Strategy

### Branch Structure

```
main (production)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ develop (integration)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/user-authentication
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/search-improvements
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hotfix/critical-security-fix
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ release/v1.2.0
```

### Branch Types and Naming Conventions

**Main Branches:**
- `main` - Production-ready code, always deployable
- `develop` - Integration branch for features (optional, we use main-based workflow)

**Supporting Branches:**
- `feature/[feature-name]` - New features and enhancements
- `bugfix/[bug-description]` - Bug fixes for development
- `hotfix/[critical-fix]` - Critical fixes for production
- `release/[version]` - Release preparation (optional)

**Naming Examples:**
```bash
‚úÖ Good:
feature/user-authentication
feature/advanced-search-filters
bugfix/listing-image-upload
hotfix/security-vulnerability-fix
release/v1.2.0

‚ùå Bad:
feature/auth
fix-bug
new-feature
john-dev-branch
```

### Git Commands and Workflow

**1. Starting New Feature Development:**
```bash
# Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create and switch to feature branch
git checkout -b feature/boat-valuation-calculator

# Verify branch
git branch
```

**2. Development Cycle:**
```bash
# Make changes and stage them
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add boat valuation calculator with market data integration

- Implement 4-step valuation wizard
- Add market data API integration
- Include condition assessment logic
- Add responsive design for mobile devices

Closes #123"

# Push to remote branch
git push origin feature/boat-valuation-calculator
```

**3. Keeping Feature Branch Updated:**
```bash
# Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin

# Rebase feature branch on main (preferred)
git rebase origin/main

# Or merge main into feature branch (alternative)
git merge origin/main

# Push updated branch
git push origin feature/boat-valuation-calculator --force-with-lease
```

**4. Creating Pull Request:**
```bash
# Push final changes
git push origin feature/boat-valuation-calculator

# Create PR via GitHub UI or CLI
gh pr create --title "Add boat valuation calculator" \
  --body "Implements comprehensive boat valuation system with market data integration"
```

## üìù Commit Message Standards

### Conventional Commits Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commit Types

- `feat`: New feature for the user
- `fix`: Bug fix for the user
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without changing functionality
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates
- `ci`: CI/CD pipeline changes
- `build`: Build system or external dependency changes

### Examples

**Good Commit Messages:**
```bash

for security and performance improvements.
```

**Bad Commit Messages:**
```bash
‚ùå fix bug
‚ùå update code
‚ùå changes
‚ùå WIP
‚ùå fixed the thing
‚ùå more updates
```

```
    /\
   /  \     E2E Tests (Few)
  /____\    
 /      \   Integration Tests (Some)
/__________\ Unit Tests (Many)
```

### Test Types and Commands

**1. Unit Tests**
```bash
# Frontend unit tests
cd frontend
npm run test              # Watch mode
npm run test:run          # Single run
npm run test:coverage     # With coverage

# Backend unit tests
cd backend
npm test                  # Run all tests
npm run test:watch        # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage     # With coverage
```

**2. Integration Tests**
```bash
# API integration tests
cd backend
npm run test:integration

# Component integration tests
cd frontend
npm run test:integration
```

**3. End-to-End Tests**
```bash
# Cypress E2E tests
cd frontend
npm run test:e2e          # Headless mode
npm run test:e2e:open     # Interactive mode
```

**4. Performance Tests**
```bash
# Load testing
npm run test:performance

# Bundle analysis
cd frontend
npm run analyze
```

### Test Writing Guidelines

**Unit Test Example:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Descriptive test with clear setup and assertions
describe('BoatValuationCalculator', () => {
  describe('calculateMarketValue', () => {
    it('should return higher value for excellent condition boats', () => {
      // Arrange
      const boatData = {
        year: 2020,
        length: 30,
        manufacturer: 'Sea Ray',
        condition: 'Excellent'
      };

      // Act
      const result = calculateMarketValue(boatData);

      // Assert
      expect(result.estimatedValue).toBeGreaterThan(100000);
      expect(result.confidence).toBeGreaterThan(0.8);
    });

    it('should handle missing manufacturer gracefully', () => {
      // Arrange
      const boatData = {
        year: 2020,
        length: 30,
        condition: 'Good'
        // manufacturer intentionally missing
      };

      // Act & Assert
      expect(() => calculateMarketValue(boatData)).not.toThrow();
    });
  });
});
```

**Integration Test Example:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Integration test with real API calls
describe('Listing API Integration', () => {
  beforeEach(async () => {
    await setupTestDatabase();
  });

  afterEach(async () => {
    await cleanupTestDatabase();
  });

  it('should create and retrieve a listing', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const listingData = {
      title: 'Test Boat',
      price: 50000,
      // ... other required fields
    };

    // Act
    const createResponse = await api.createListing(listingData);
    const retrieveResponse = await api.getListing(createResponse.listingId);

    // Assert
    expect(createResponse.success).toBe(true);
    expect(retrieveResponse.listing.title).toBe('Test Boat');
  });
});
```

## üîí Security Workflow
