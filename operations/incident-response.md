## Response Procedures

### Phase 1: Detection and Triage (0-15 minutes)

#### Incident Detection
- **Automated Monitoring:**
  - CloudWatch alarms
  - Application performance monitoring
  - Security event detection
  - User error reports

- **Manual Reporting:**
  - Customer support tickets
  - Team member reports
  - Third-party notifications
  - Social media monitoring

#### Initial Triage
1. **Assess severity level**
2. **Identify affected systems**
3. **Estimate user impact**
4. **Activate response team**
5. **Create incident record**

### Phase 2: Investigation and Containment (15-60 minutes)

#### Investigation Steps
1. **Gather information**
   - System logs and metrics
   - Error messages and stack traces
   - User reports and feedback
   - Timeline of events

2. **Identify root cause**
   - System component analysis
   - Code review if applicable
   - Infrastructure assessment
   - Third-party service status

3. **Assess impact**
   - Affected user count
   - Business impact assessment
   - Data integrity check
   - Security implications

#### Containment Actions
- **Immediate containment:**
  - Isolate affected systems
  - Disable problematic features
  - Implement temporary workarounds
  - Prevent further damage

- **Security containment:**
  - Block malicious traffic
  - Revoke compromised credentials
  - Isolate affected accounts
  - Preserve evidence

### Phase 3: Resolution and Recovery (1-4 hours)

#### Resolution Process
1. **Develop fix strategy**
2. **Test solution in staging**
3. **Implement fix in production**
4. **Verify resolution**
5. **Monitor for recurrence**

#### Recovery Procedures
- **System restoration:**
  - Restart affected services
  - Restore from backups if needed
  - Validate system functionality
  - Performance verification

- **Data recovery:**
  - Restore corrupted data
  - Verify data integrity
  - Update affected records
  - Reconcile transactions

### Phase 4: Communication and Documentation

#### Internal Communication
- **Team updates:**
  - Slack incident channel
  - Email notifications
  - Status dashboard updates
  - Management briefings

#### External Communication
- **Customer communication:**
  - Status page updates
  - Email notifications
  - Social media updates
  - Support ticket responses

#### Documentation Requirements
- **Incident timeline**
- **Actions taken**
- **Root cause analysis**
- **Resolution steps**
- **Lessons learned**
