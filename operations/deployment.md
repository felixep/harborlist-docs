# Operations Deployment

## Overview

This guide covers the deployment process for the HarborList platform across different environments.

## Environments

### Development
- **Purpose:** Local development and testing
- **URL:** `http://localhost:3000`
- **Database:** Local SQLite or PostgreSQL
- **Status:** Available for development

### Staging
- **Purpose:** Pre-production testing and validation
- **URL:** TBD (when implemented)
- **Database:** Staging database instance
- **Status:** Implementation complete, deployment pending

### Production
- **Purpose:** Live application serving end users
- **URL:** TBD (when implemented)
- **Database:** Production database instance
- **Status:** Implementation complete, deployment pending

## Deployment Process

### Prerequisites

1. AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
2. CDK toolkit installed and bootstrapped
3. Environment variables configured
4. Database migrations tested

### Infrastructure Deployment

```bash
# Deploy infrastructure
cd infrastructure
npm run deploy

# Verify deployment
npm run verify
```

### Application Deployment

```bash
# Build applications
cd backend && npm run build
cd frontend && npm run build

# Deploy to AWS
npm run deploy:production
```

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variables

Each environment requires specific configuration:

- Database connection strings
- API keys and secrets
- Feature flags
- Monitoring configuration

### Security Considerations

- SSL/TLS certificates
- Database encryption
- API authentication
- Network security groups

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
- API endpoint monitoring
- Database connectivity
- Application performance metrics

### Backup Procedures
- Database backups
- Configuration backups
- Disaster recovery procedures

## Rollback Procedures

In case of deployment issues:

1. Identify the issue
2. Execute rollback script
3. Verify system stability
4. Investigate and fix the root cause

## Status

The deployment infrastructure and processes are implemented and ready for use (implementation status) (implementation status). Actual deployment to staging and production environments is pending business requirements and approval.
