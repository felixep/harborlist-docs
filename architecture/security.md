# Architecture Security

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures and practices implemented in the HarborList platform.

## Authentication

### JWT Token Authentication
- Secure token-based authentication
- Configurable token expiration
- Refresh token mechanism
- Secure token storage practices

### Password Security
- Bcrypt hashing with salt
- Password complexity requirements
- Account lockout protection
- Secure password reset flow

## Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- User roles: Admin, User, Guest
- Permission-based access control
- Resource-level permissions
- API endpoint protection

### Admin Access
- Separate admin authentication
- Enhanced security requirements
- Audit logging for admin actions
- Multi-factor authentication support

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- Data encryption at rest
- TLS encryption in transit
- Database field-level encryption for sensitive data
- Secure key management

### Data Privacy
- Personal data protection
- GDPR compliance considerations
- Data retention policies
- Secure data deletion

## API Security

### Input Validation
- Request payload validation
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

### Rate Limiting
- API request rate limiting
- DDoS protection
- Abuse prevention
- Monitoring and alerting

## Infrastructure Security

### Network Security
- VPC configuration
- Security groups
- Network ACLs
- Private subnets for databases

### Monitoring and Logging
- Security event logging
- Intrusion detection
- Audit trails
- Real-time alerting

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Scanning
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static code analysis
- Dynamic security testing
- Container security scanning

### Manual Security Testing
- Penetration testing procedures
- Security code reviews
- Threat modeling
- Vulnerability assessments

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedures
1. Incident detection and reporting
2. Initial response and containment
3. Investigation and analysis
4. Recovery and remediation
5. Post-incident review

### Contact Information
- Security team contacts
- Escalation procedures
- External security resources

## Compliance

### Standards and Frameworks
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- Security best practices
- Industry standards adherence
- Regular security assessments

## Status

Security measures are implemented and actively maintained. Regular security reviews and updates are performed to address emerging threats.
