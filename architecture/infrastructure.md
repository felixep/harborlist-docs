# Architecture Infrastructure

## Overview

This document describes the technical architecture of the HarborList platform.

## System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

The HarborList platform follows a modern web application architecture with the following components:

- **Frontend:** React-based single-page application
- **Backend:** Node.js REST API server
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for data persistence
- **Infrastructure:** AWS cloud services
- **CDN:** Cloudflare with S3 static website hosting via VPC endpoint

### Architecture Principles

- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear boundaries between frontend, backend, and data layers
- **Scalability:** Designed for horizontal scaling
- **Security:** Security-first approach with multiple layers of protection
- **Maintainability:** Modular design for easy maintenance and updates

## Component Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

```
Frontend (React)
├── Components/          # Reusable UI components
├── Pages/              # Route-specific page components
├── Services/           # API communication layer
├── Hooks/              # Custom React hooks
├── Utils/              # Utility functions
└── Types/              # TypeScript type definitions
```

### Backend Architecture

```
Backend (Node.js)
├── Routes/             # API route handlers
├── Services/           # Business logic layer
├── Models/             # Data models and validation
├── Middleware/         # Request processing middleware
├── Utils/              # Utility functions
└── Config/             # Configuration management
```

## Data Architecture

### Database Design

- **Users:** User account information and authentication
- **Listings:** Boat listing data and metadata
- **Media:** Image and file storage references
- **Audit:** System audit logs and user activity

### Data Flow

1. User interactions through frontend
2. API requests to backend services
3. Business logic processing
4. Database operations
5. Response back to frontend

## Infrastructure Architecture

### AWS Services

- **EC2:** Cloudflare Tunnel daemon hosting
- **RDS:** Database hosting
- **S3:** File storage and static website hosting
- **VPC:** Private network with VPC endpoint for S3 access
- **Route 53:** DNS management (optional)

### Deployment Architecture

- **Development:** Local development environment
- **Staging:** Pre-production testing environment
- **Production:** Live application environment

## Security Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. User login with credentials
2. JWT token generation
3. Token-based API authentication
4. Role-based authorization

### Data Security
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

## Performance Architecture

### Optimization Strategies
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategies
- CDN utilization
- Image optimization
- Code splitting and lazy loading

### Monitoring
- Application performance monitoring
- Database performance tracking
- Infrastructure monitoring
- User experience metrics

## Integration Architecture

### External Services
- Payment processing integration
- Email service integration
- Analytics and tracking
- Third-party APIs

### API Design
- RESTful API principles
- Consistent response formats
- Error handling standards
- API versioning strategy

## Status

The architecture is implemented and actively maintained. Regular reviews and updates are performed to ensure scalability and performance requirements are met.
